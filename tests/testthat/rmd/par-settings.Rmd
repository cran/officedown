```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, fig.cap = TRUE)
library(officedown)
library(officer)
fp <- fp_par(
  text.align = "center", 
  padding.bottom = 20, padding.top = 120, 
  border.bottom = fp_border(),
  word_style = "Normal")
```

A paragraph with a call to `fp` in an R inline chunk is
inheriting the defined properties. `r fp`

That's it.
