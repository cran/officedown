Argument plot is expected to be a list. It can contain few items to style
figures and figure captions.


You don't have to provide values for each items of the list, missing items are
replaced by default values. Possible items are:

* `style`: the name of the "Word" paragraph style to use for the paragraphs that will contain a graphic.
* `align`: alignment of paragraphs containing graphics (possible values are 'left', 'right' and 'center').
* `topcaption`: specify whether the legend should appear above the graphic (`TRUE`) or below the graphic (`FALSE`).
* `fig.lp`: Sequence identifier for figure legends. All graphics' captions are supposed to
have the same identifier. This value is used for different features:

  - It is used to insert a table of figures.
  - It is also used to prefix your 'bookdown' cross-reference call; if `fig.lp`
    is set to "fig:", a cross-reference to the figure with id "xxxxx" is written
    as `\@ref(fig:xxxxx)`. 

  It is possible to set the Word default value (in
  French for example, it is "Figure"), you can then manually add a list of
  figures (go to the "References" tab and select the "Insert a table of
  figures" menu).

* `caption`: a list for captions' options, i.e.
  * `style`: the name of the "Word" paragraph style to use for the paragraphs that will contain figures' captions.
  * `pre`: prefix for numbering chunk (default to "Figure ").
  * `sep`: suffix for numbering chunk (default to ": ").
  * `tnd`: (only applies if positive). Inserts the number of the last title of level `tnd` (i.e. 4.3-2 for figure 2 of chapter 4.3).
  * `tns`: separator to use between title number and figure number. Default is "-".
  * `fp_text`: text formatting properties to apply to caption prefix - see [officer::fp_text_lite()].


Default value is (in YAML format):

```yaml
style: Normal
align: center
topcaption: false
fig.lp: 'fig:'
caption:
  style: Image Caption
  pre: 'Figure '
  sep: ': '
  tnd: 0
  tns: '-'
  fp_text: !expr officer::fp_text_lite(bold = TRUE)
```
