```{r, child = "./setup.Rmd", include = FALSE}
```

You can access them in the Word template used. Function
[styles_info()][officer::styles_info] can let you read these
styles.

You need 'officer' to read the stylenames (to get information
from a specific "reference_docx", change `ref_docx_default`
in the example below.

```{r}
library(officer)
docx_file <- system.file(package = "officer", "template", "template.docx")
doc <- read_docx(docx_file)
```

To read `paragraph` stylenames:

```{r}
styles_info(doc, type = "paragraph")[, 1:6]
```

To read `table` stylenames:

```{r}
styles_info(doc, type = "table")[, 1:6]
```

To read `list` stylenames:

```{r}
styles_info(doc, type = "numbering")[, 1:6]
```
